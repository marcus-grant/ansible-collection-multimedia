## External requirements

which requirements are needed.

## Using this collection

```bash

```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via
`ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: marcus_grant.multimedia
```

To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following
command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install marcus_grant.multimedia --upgrade

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you
need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report
an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax where `X.Y.Z` can be any
[available version](https://galaxy.ansible.com/marcus_grant/multimedia):

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install marcus_grant.multimedia:==X.Y.Z
```
